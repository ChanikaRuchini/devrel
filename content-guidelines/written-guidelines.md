# Written Content Guidelines

## Objective

This guideline encourages straightforward, friendly, and informative written content for our products. The [developer-advocacy guide](https://developer-advocacy.com/write-great-posts-and-articles) is a great resource.

## Primary Components

### Technical depth

Most people can recognize a marketing plug in an article within the first few sentences. The technical audience is even better at it. Written content should have a necessary dept for the reader to have a reason to spend time with it. The technical subject should be the only focus, and any mention of product or promotion needs to come through naturally or not at all. A sponsor section can be added but should be clearly labeled, allowing the reader to decide if they want to learn about a product

### Write drafts

Getting all of the content written down and reviewed by a peer can solve early problems. Initial feedback and finding issues early will mean the readers won't find a first draft and lose credibility for the content or author.
